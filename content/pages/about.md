title: Noble Legacy
intro: "Hi there! We’re Andy and Ashley Greenwood and we own, operate, and live
  on our century farm in Northwest Missouri with our 2 kiddos. We started Noble
  Cuts Meat Co., with one goal in mind: Deliver Goodness to your family table.
  Our meat is free of artificial additives, preservatives, fillers and hormones
  - in other words, it’s natural, healthy, and pretty darn delicious! We’re
  proud to put it on our dinner table and we’re happy to be able to offer it to
  your family!"
