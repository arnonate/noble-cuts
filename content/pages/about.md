title: Noble Legacy
intro: >
  Hi there! We’re Andy and Ashley Greenwood and we own, operate, and live a century farm in Northwest Missouri with our 2 kiddos.
  For those you who may not know what a century farm is, it simply means we have had been recognized for having this farmland in our family for at least 100 years. We have been working the soil when times were good and even when they weren’t so good, like during The Great Depression.
  What that means to you -- we are here to stay; we aren’t going anywhere.

  We started Noble Cuts Meat Co., with one goal in mind: deliver American-grown, beef-goodness to your family’s table. We take our service to our land and to our customers seriously.
  You can taste it every bite. We look forward to meeting you soon.
  Thank you,
  Ashley & Andy
faqs:
  - question: "How is my order delivered?"
    answer: "We currently deliver to the following Missouri counties: Andrew,
      Buchanan, Caldwell, Carroll, Clay, Clinton, Davies, Dekalb, Grundy,
      Jackson, Lafayette, Livingston, Platte, Ray, and Saline. Local pickup is
      available by appointment only and orders must be picked up within 7 days
      of your order being ready.If you would like your order shipped, please
      contact us for pricing."
  - question: Can I pick up my order?
    answer: Local pickup is available by appointment only and orders must be picked up within 7 days of your ready date.
  - question: Do you offer shipping?
    answer: If you would like your order shipped, please contact us for pricing.
  - question: How much space do I need in my deep freezer?
    answer:
      Typically, you’ll want to allow yourself 1 cubic foot of freezer space
      for 35-40 lbs. of meat. Quarter cow (approximately 160 lbs.) = 4 cubic
      feet. Half cow (approximately 320 lbs.) = 8 cubic feet. Whole cow
      (approximately 640 lbs.) = 16 cubic feet. These are estimates and amount
      of beef will vary by cow.
  - question: Am I only paying for the pounds of meat I get?
    answer: That’s correct. You will only pay for the exact number of pounds you
      receive with your order. Your down payment covers 50% of the hanging
      weight of the biggest possible cow we have (850 lbs). However, most cows
      will be smaller. When your order is ready, we will invoice you a 2nd
      payment which will typically be less money than your down payment.
  - question: What type of beef?
    answer: USDA inspected Black Angus. Delicious.
  - question: How cold does the meat need stay in my freezer?
    answer:
      It is safest to store your frozen beef at 0’F. We store all of our beef
      in a -4’F environment prior to delivery/shipping.
  - question: Are your cows grass fed or corn fed?
    answer: Our cattle are grass fed and grain finished. Grass fed beef is more natural to the cow’s digestive system which creates less stressed, healthier cows. The last 90 days of corn feeding is important, because unlike pork and poultry, cows deposit fat inside their meat causing the beautiful marbling you see in our choice cuts. Marbling is essential to producing a more flavorful, tender cut of meat.
  - question: Do I get to pick my cuts?
    answer: >-
      We have our select processing package of hamburger, brisket, chuck roast,
      tri-tip steak, KC Strip steak, top sirloin steak, Filet, ribeye steak and
      Kabob pieces. Bundled boxes, quarter, and half are predetermined

      cuts. If you purchase a whole cow you can use our pre-determined package or choose your own cuts. Other cuts are available upon request, please contact us for more information.
  - question:
      How customizable is my order? For instance, can I decide the thickness
      of my steaks?
    answer:
      "Our predetermined cuts are: Filet mignon 1.5 inches / all over steak
      cuts are 1.25 inches but can vary depending on meat group size. Chuck
      roasts are cut to fit in a crock pot, briskets weigh an average of 2-4
      lbs. If you select a whole cow, you can choose what size you like each of
      your cuts. Please contact us for more information."
  - question: "Will you ship my order to me? "
    answer: Absolutely! However, because the weight of each order and shipping
      prices vary, please contact us for a custom quote.
  - question: How long will it take to receive my order?
    answer: Our Noble bundle is available immediately. For quarters, halves, and
      wholes, delivery will vary depending on processing availability and type
      of request, but typically you can expect to receive your order in 2-4
      weeks.
  - question: How many people will a quarter, half, or whole feed?
    answer: Our family of four can live comfortably on a whole cow for one year.
